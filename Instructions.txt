As explained in class, you are required to implement simulation of Distributed File System with a single system image and replication support. 

You need to demonstrate your project on atleast 3 servers  (physically separate machines) and 2 clients (clients can run on server machines).

1) You need to submit the entire source code with executable files and a help file on how to compile and install your project on a new machine (both client and server). 2) Also you need to submit on LMS and bring a print-out of the report that will atleast cover:

a. Architecture of Your Code covering: 
    1. what semantics were chosen etc.
    2. Overall flow of messages and components designed (processes, threads etc.)
b. Assumptions if any
